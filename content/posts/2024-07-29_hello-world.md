I recently attended the CIY MOVE conference with my Chruch's youth
group. It was a life-changing perspective, and provided me with a
fresh perspective on life. I gave up my life to God, and now I'm
figuring out what to do next.

Upon arriving back home from the conference (the conference was in
Tennesee, and we live in Florida), members of our group were given the
opportunity to receive "challenge cards". Each card contained a long
term challenge that the receiver had to complete. I, along with my
youth pastor, received the "Note Taker card". The card read as
follows:

> ***Note Taker***
>
> *For the next year, commit to taking handwritten notes every time you*
> *listen to a seromor at church or online.*
>
> *Share what you're learning once a week with a group leader or a*
> *peer.*

Cool. I need to take more notes, anyways. I've been pursuing
self-development for a while, but I've never done a good job of recording
what I learn. I'm taking this challenge as a sign that I need to get on
that.

However, while handwritten notes are great, they're hard to share.

I've had the idea of creating an online blog for a while, and this was
the final push I needed. I've decided to commit to note-taking wholly,
recording everything I learn, from not only sermons, but from Bible
study and self-develppment books as well. Once notes have been
handwritten, I can transcribe them into markdown files, which will
then be displayed on this website for others to read.

I also figure that I can also transcribe the occasional journal entry,
if I happen to write something that might be valuable to others. This
will help me develop my currently very poor typing skills (I am a chronic
chicken pecker) and also hopefully my general ability to write for others
to read (instead of just myself).

I hope you can learn something from this website, eventually. Once I
start transcribing new notes, you should be able to access them from the
sidebar.

I think it's pretty evident that this is my first time writing a blog
post. It'll get better from here, I promise. If you want to talk with me
about anything on your mind (or complain about my writing skills) then
don't be afraid to shoot me an email by clicking on the little mail icon.
I'd be happy to talk to you.

Remember, Jesus loves you - keep learning.

I'm going to go take some notes.
